THIRD MEETING (November 14th, 2022 6:15PM)
- Covered what we have done since last meeting
    - Each of us did at least one story who had one assigned
- Advised to more carefully follow the rubric
    - This includes the following:
        - Weekly release notes with description of what happened during the past week
        - Submit weekly meeting notes to appropriate folder
        - Track times met throughout week
- Advised to redirect project focus away from third party API and use dummy data instead

- What needs to be completed this week
    - A full prototype of the website (without third-party API integration)
