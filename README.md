## Brief Application description:

Freshmen living on campus have meal plans which reset every week. However, people rarely use all their meal plans and often have extra. Thus, theyâ€™re wasted during the weekly reset. 

The Buff Bites provides CU Boulder students with a way to expend extra meal plans through various methods without wasting their value. There are options to donate extra meal plans to charity, sell them to those who need them, etc. Furthermore, those who want/need meal plans can purchase more.
