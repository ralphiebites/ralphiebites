## Brief Application description:

Freshmen living on campus have meal plans which reset every week. However, people rarely use all their meals for the week and are, thus, wasted during the weekly reset. Ralphie Bites provides CU students with a way to expend extra meal plans through various methods without wasting their value. There are options to donate extra meals to food insecure students, sell them to students willing to buy meals at a discount, and track meal plan activity to monitor usage. In essence, Ralphie Bites establishes a market for meal plans, connecting students who desire to sell meals with students seeking to buy meals, providing financial incentives on both sides and reducing waste from unused meal swipes.
With this application, users can save their information within an account and perform transactions through it. Moreover, users can browse through available meal plan offers and negotiate prices with other users. The app will allow users to save their IdentiKey and password for quick access along with payment methods for transactions. Additionally, an anonymous list of food insecure students will be provided along with an option for the user to donate to them. All around, Ralphie Bites increases the practicality of meal plans, reducing costs for students and providing an option for food insecure students to receive meals without question.
